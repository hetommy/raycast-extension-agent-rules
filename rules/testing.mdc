# Testing Raycast Extensions

## Critical Testing Workflow

When testing a Raycast extension from a PR, **always change into the extension directory first**:

```bash
# Navigate to the specific extension directory and run all commands in one chain
cd /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME && pwd && ls package.json && npm install && npm run dev
```

**Alternative step-by-step approach (if needed):**
```bash
# Navigate to the specific extension directory
cd /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME

# CRITICAL: Verify you're in the right directory
pwd
# Should show: /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME

# Install dependencies first
npm install

# Then run development commands
npm run dev
```

## Common Mistake to Avoid

**❌ Don't run npm commands from the root directory:**
```bash
cd /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions
npm run dev  # This will fail - no package.json here!
```

**❌ Don't check directory then run commands from wrong location:**
```bash
cd /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/pick-your-wallpaper
pwd  # Shows correct directory
# But then running commands from parent directory - WRONG!
```

**✅ Recommended: Run all commands in one chain:**
```bash
cd /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/pick-your-wallpaper && pwd && ls package.json && npm install && npm run dev
```

**✅ Alternative: Step-by-step with verification:**
```bash
cd /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/pick-your-wallpaper
pwd  # Verify you're in the right place
ls package.json  # Confirm package.json exists
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Why This Matters

- Each extension is in its own subdirectory with its own `package.json`
- The root `/raycast-extensions` directory doesn't contain extension-specific files
- Running npm commands from the wrong directory will result in "ENOENT: no such file or directory" errors
- **Shell state can be misleading**: Even if `pwd` shows the correct directory, commands might still run from the wrong location
- **Always verify with `ls package.json`** before running npm commands

## Verification Steps

1. **Check your current directory:**
   ```bash
   pwd
   # Should show: /Users/tommy/Cursor/raycast-extensions/EXTENSION_NAME
   ```

2. **Verify package.json exists:**
   ```bash
   ls package.json
   # Should show the package.json file
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # This is required before running dev
   ```

4. **Then proceed with testing:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Integration with PR Review Process

This testing workflow should be integrated with the existing PR review process documented in `reviews.mdc`. The key addition is ensuring you're in the correct directory before running any npm commands.
